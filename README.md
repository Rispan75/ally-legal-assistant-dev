# Office 365 Legal Plugin  
  
## Overview  
  
The Office 365 Legal Plugin is a powerful tool designed to enhance the efficiency and productivity of legal professionals when reviewing contracts. Similar to solutions like Harvey and Spellbook, this plugin leverages advanced AI capabilities to help lawyers summarize, review, check for policy and compliance, and make corrections and redlining in a fast and efficient manner. Built with Microsoft's best-of-breed technologies, it offers an end-to-end solution using Azure infrastructure, Azure AI, and Office 365, with the flexibility of an open-source code base for customization.  
  
## Key Features  
  
- **Efficient Contract Review:** Streamline the process of contract review with AI-driven summarization and analysis.  
- **Policy and Compliance Checks:** Ensure compliance with company policies through integrated policy checks.  
- **Customizable Solution:** Modify and extend functionalities with access to the open-source code.  
- **Flexible Deployment Options:** Deploy locally or use Docker with AKS, or integrate with Azure AI Studio and PromptFlow.  
  
## Architecture  
  
The plugin's architecture consists of a front-end UI, developed in JavaScript, integrated directly into Microsoft Word as an Office 365 plugin. The back end employs Azure PromptFlow, which acts as an orchestration engine triggered by plugin commands. PromptFlow operates in AKS with Docker or in Azure AI Studio, utilizing two Azure AI Search indexesâ€”one for document data and another for company policy. The runtime for PromptFlow is Python, enabling Azure OpenAI LLM calls for summarization and compliance checks. The solution's configuration, including API keys, is stored within the plugin and can be modified via the configuration tab.
